Android-Compatibility
=============

'''Android-Compatibility''' is a library project used to provide single interface for all android devices (2.x, 3.x, 4.x) to use some features (like action bar) which are not available in lower android version. 

Primary component in Android-Compatibility - action bar, but some other features will be implemented later.

Action bar for Android 3.x and 4.x is represented by system action bar, while for android 2.x it's adaptive component, which is designed to be looked native and use the minimum of device's screen.
